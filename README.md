# Comparing Sequential and Functional Neural Networks in Keras

A simple project using the CCCP dataset from UCI to explore how Sequential API differs from Functional API.

The key differences are that Functional offers more flexibility than the sequential API.
Furthermore, a single functional NN can be used to predict >1 O/P variables, whereas in sequential NNs, two networks would be needed for 2 O/Ps, three for 3 O/Ps, and so on.
